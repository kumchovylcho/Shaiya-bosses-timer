# Shaiya-bosses-timer
Times the bosses of the game


1. Sorts the timers ascending. Means that the boss which will spawn sooner will be always on top. Sorting is applied every time you add a new timer.

2. It gets red when the minutes are below 10, so its easier to track.
3. Timers bigger than 10minutes are green.
4. Timers are updated every 1 second.
